This integration is available in the [Home Assistant Community Store](https://hacs.xyz/).

## Setup and Configuration

- You currently need to add `--http-bind-address 0.0.0.0` to the `goxlr-daemon` command in your respective OS. See [here](https://github.com/GoXLR-on-Linux/goxlr-utility/issues/64) for progress on this being added to the UI. For Windows, the easiest way is to edit the shortcut in `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` and add the argument to the end of the `Target` field.
